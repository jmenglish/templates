        <p>The competitors studied for this project were Google Drive, EverNote, and Dropbox.
          The research was performed with a user survey sent out to contacts, friends, social media,
          and subreddit. The focus of the survey was to get an understanding of users current behaviors,
          preferences, missing features that would be an asset, and demographics of our target audience.

        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <br>

        <h5><b>Goal</b></h5>
        <br>
        <p>The client wanted to know was if collaborating was a feature that was found useful and in demand.
          The participants in this survey rated collaborating as the least important feature.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5><b>Findings</b></h5>
        <br>
        <p>The features participants found most useful are uploading content to store and share with others;
          such as pictures and PDFs. It’s not surprising because these are the basic functions of a Cloud Storage
          and Organization Service.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>These users are more concerned with saving information off of their mobile devices to increase storage
          space and keep information secure.

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Iterations</b></h5>
        <p>The wireframes went through many iterations to determine the content to include and in what format
          that would best serve the user. The iterations underwent preference tests to narrow down the most
          functional options.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Homepage</b></h5>
        <p>With the home page, two versions were created and tested against each other. In the first version,
          all of the content was included in a one-page layout to reduce user scrolling, provide company info,
          product features within view, and entice the user to signup with plan options up front. In the second
          version, the focus was solely on the product's features and testimonials to entice users to signup.
          The about and plan/pricing information was moved to a separate page. The preference test showed that
          a majority of participants preferred a one-page layout regardless of extra scrolling. They wanted to
          see all content in one location which would minimize clicking, highlight the features, and introduce
          pricing. With this feedback, the homepage was updated to focus on product features, customer testimonials,
          and plan details.

          <!-- IMPORTANT: insert images below body.-->
        <br>

        <h5><b>Dashboard</b></h5>
        <p>There were many versions of the dashboard to narrow down how to display the features appropriately.
          User testing was utilized to find the optimal layout for users to easily access items for sharing or
          collaborating. A majority of participants stated that all information in view on the dashboard would
          simplify navigation making it more accessible by reducing unnecessary steps.  Also, it would be easier
          to organize and find all content within view. These limitations were removed changing the folder structure
          to give users control of organizing content, naming their content, and by placing all features (upload,
          create, share, and collaborate) in the immediate view. The design was modified to group actions together
          in an ellipsis drop-down menu eliminating separate pages.

          information we store and create has a similar chaotic feel until the structure that works for us is actualized.
          Within our organic creativity we find vibrant beauty to bring into existence and share with others.

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <br>

        <h5><b>Iterations</b></h5>
        <p>The feedback gathered from the Wireframe User Testing was used to improve on and drive the direction of the
          high-fidelity designs. In this round of iterations, improvements to areas that were inconsistent or did not
          function well for users were addressed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5><b>Homepage</b></h5>
        <p>The homepage design went through a series of iterations and testing to find the most useful and appealing assets
          for the product. For example,the hero image underwent preference tests to narrow down a selection that not only
          spoke to the product but also the users. A significant amount of users selected the final hero image because
          they felt it was warm, vibrant, and grabbed their attention. But don’t take their word for it.

          <p>Insert Desktop homepage image</p>
          <!-- IMPORTANT: insert images below body.-->
        <br>

        <h5><b>Dashboard</b></h5>
        <p>On the dashboard, participants pointed to steps that did not flow naturally and provided improvements
          to simplify the process. For example, they had trouble organizing an item because the action icon in the
          ellipsis menu was not clear to them. Hover text was included to clarify each icon. Also, icons were selected
          to easily identify each file type (word, excel, PDF,etc.).
        <br>
          Further refinement to the dashboard included removing the files page and combining all content onto the main
          page to increase productivity. This simplified the dashboard to include all items in one convenient location
          and allow the user more control in organizing their content.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <br>
        <p>There were two types of testing performed for this case study: recorded in person or remote and
          UsabilityHub preference tests.User testing for this product was performed for desktop only of both
          the home page and dashboard of this product. In hindsight,testing should have included mobile because
          the participants on the survey frequently used mobile apps such as Google Drive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Remote/In-person Testing</b></h5>
        <br>
        <p>For the in-person/remote user testing, the participants completed three tasks: sign up for an account,
          add a piece of content, and organize a form of content to the dashboard. They were encouraged to speak
          their thoughts out loud on the experience of navigating through each page. With this approach to testing,
          I could observe the exact areas of the test participants struggled with and ask prompting questions to collect data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Perference Testing</b></h5>
        <br>
        <p>For the Preference Test, participants voted on UsabilityHub for their preferred design. User insight was
          gathered on the content layout, features, or design choices for both the homepage and dashboard. The results
          were very helpful in guiding the evolution of wireframes and in finalizing design choices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Findings</b></h5>
        <br>
        <p>While working on the mockups for the homepage, I started questioning the layout of information in the wireframes.
          After reviewing other website templates to generate ideas, a second design option was created. The second option
          included more images in a checkered pattern layout with the content. These changes were made to improve the UI design.
          A preference test was used to gather feedback on which UI experience user's preferred. The results showed that a large
          majority of participants enjoyed the original layout because it was simple and more natural to read the information. In the end,
          my doubts about the initial design choice for the homepage was discredited by the participant's approval. Lesson learned!

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The assumptions made during this making of this product surrounded on the idea that users would want a tool to not
          only store data but collaborate on their business and personal ideas. Also, I over looked the amount of users that
          preferred the mobile app of compeititors over web-based services. The sketches and wireframes were created for web-based
          initially when they should have been focused on mobile and then branched out.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The next phase of this project would be to return to the mobile designs and focus more user testing on mobile apps.
          With this data, refine the final designs to include the best features and user experience.
